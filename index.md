## Overview

### What are development containers?
A development container allows you to use a [Docker container](https://www.docker.com/) as a full-featured development environment. It can be used to run an application, to separate tools, libraries, or runtimes needed for working with a codebase, and to aid in continuous integration and testing.

## What is this specification?

The Development Containers specification seeks to find ways to enrich existing formats with common development specific settings, tools, and configuration while still providing a simplified, un-orchestrated single container option â€“ so that they can be used as coding environments or for continuous integration and testing.
