## Overview

### What are development containers?
Containers are pieces of software that package code and all of the dependencies that code needs to run, including the runtime, tools, libraries, and settings. Development containers (aka "dev containers") specifically let you code within this piece of software, providing a separate coding environment from your computer.

A `devcontainer.json` file in your project tells your editor how to access (or create) a development container with a well-defined tool and runtime stack. This container can be used to run an application or to separate tools, libraries, or runtimes needed for working with a codebase.

## What is this specification?

As containerizing production workloads becomes commonplace, more developers are using containers for scenarios beyond deployment including continuous integration, test automation, and even full-featured coding environments.
